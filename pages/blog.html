Development has been a major pursuit of humanity for a long time now. People havetried to improve their ways of life by innovating numerous and diverse things. One of the greatest advancements of the times has been technology. We now like in a world where
                        every teen has a mobile device in their hand, where paper books are being replaced by
                        e-books and surprisingly where even toddler are lured by gadgets! Computer
                        technology in particular has taken the world by storm. Whether its forecasting the
                        weather or performing even a minor calculation, there is no denying in the fact that
                        technology has become our true savior.

                        In the present context, the positive impact technology has put forth is boundless. Here
                        are some of the benefits in miscellaneous fields that computer technology has to offer:

                        devoted to every imaginable topic make research efficient and highly rewarding.

                        students attain knowledge virtually. Such facility has helped students, despite their
                        economic status, assuage their craving for wisdom. Furthermore, the use multimedia
                        has made learning more interactive boosting the efficiency of students to understand

                        The immense advantages of technology has nullified the its downside in the
                        contemporary society. Some drawbacks of technological advancement can be
                        illustrated as:

                       
                       <br>
                       
                        <br/>
                        <div>Depedency</div>
                        Having access to a treasure-trove of resources is wonderful, but it can also create a
                        condition of dependency. As most technological discoveries aim to reduce human effort,
                        the human is becoming obsolete as processes become automated and jobs are made
                        redundant.

                        <div>Social Disconnect</div>
                        
                        
                        There is an increasing tendency for people to socialize and communicate via digital
                        devices rather than through real life contact. This can easily lead to a sense of
                        disconnect and isolation. Studies have suggested that the lack of real life contact is
                        causing depression and other forms of mental illness in many people.

                        The outgrowth of Internet has unknowingly paved its path toward dangers as people are
                        being a victim of Cyber-crime on a daily basis. It has also made us question the security
                        of confidential data and millions of dollars that are in risk due to unethical means
                        through the use of computers.

                        We humans have thrived and left no stone unturned to quench our thirst for more and
                        more advanced technology in hope to ease our burdensome lifestyle. It is crystal clear that the
                        modern world does indeed place too much reliance on technology. On the one hand it does
                        make our lives easier; but at what expense? Undoubtedly, the pros of technology outweighs its
                        cons by a huge margin. But it does not mean that the negative aspects are something to be
                        overseen. In my opinion, whilst we relish the boon of technology, we must be totally conscious
                        to keep it within its limit so that it doesn’t turn into bane.
